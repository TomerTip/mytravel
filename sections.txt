*{{marker|type=do|name=Abricó|lat=-23.04810|long=-43.51286}} (oceanic, nudist beach)
Abricó is the only official nudist beach in the city of Rio de Janeiro, it lies next to Grumari beach. Only accessible by car/taxi. A cheaper option is taking the bus numbered 360 (Recreio) that passes along Copacabana/Ipanema/Leblon, and from the end of the line (ponto final) take a cab.

It is also worth visiting the beaches in [[Paquetá]], particularly:
* Praia da Moreninha (on the Guanabara Bay, but often not clean enough for swimming)

Cariocas have a unique '''beach culture''', with a code of customs which outlanders (even Brazilians from other cities) can misconstrue easily. Women may wear tiny string bikinis, but that does not mean they are trying to attract a man. Until the 1990s, men and boys wore ''speedos'', but since then wearing Bermuda shorts or boardshorts has become more common, although speedos ("sungas" in Portuguese) seem to now be making a comeback. Jammers are less common but still accepted.

Waves in Rio vary from tiny and calm in the Guanabara bay beaches (Paquetá, Ramos, Flamengo, Botafogo, Urca) to high, surf-ideal waves in Recreio. In Leme, Copacabana, Arpoador, Ipanema, and Leblon, there's a popular way of "riding" the waves called ''pegar jacaré'' (pe-GAHR zha-kah-REH; literally, "to grab an alligator"). You wait for the wave to come behind you then swim on top of it until it crumbles next to the sand.

Commerce is common in Rio's beaches, with thousands of walking vendors selling everything from sun glasses to fried shrimp to cooling beverages (try ''mate com limão'', a local ice tea mixed with lemonade, or ''suco de laranja com cenoura'', orange and carrot juice). For food, there is also ''empada'' (baked flour pastry filled with meat or cheese) and ''sanduíche natural'' (cool sandwich with vegetables and mayo). Vendors typically shout out loud what they're selling, but they won't usually bother you unless you call them. All along the beaches there are also permanent vendors who will sell you a beer and also rent you a beach chair and an umbrella for a few Reais.

Leblon and Ipanema are the most cool beaches. The beaches in Barra and Recreio (Quebra-Mar, Pepê, Pontal, Prainha, Grumari) are the best and cleanest beaches, being the favorite among surfers, paragliders and nautical sports. São Conrado beach is a hang gliders paradise.

In the West Zone you can find some of the best beaches of Rio de Janeiro. Barra da Tijuca's beach is a {{km|17}} sand line of clear waters. Surfers love it, and many people also. The sunset is beautiful, especially during the winter. The beach is relatively safe at night, although development of tourism by big hotels such as the Sheraton have brought with it the inevitable appearance of (discreet but ever present) prostitutes. As you go along you get to Recreio, which is even clearer, and much less crowded. Prainha is now very far away from the crowded Copacabana. Its perfect waves made it famous. It is also on a biological reserve, with restricted car parking spaces. Avoid the weekends and enjoy this between mountains-beauty of the nature on the week-days.
There are many surfing schools all along the Barra beach that hold one and half hour surfing classes. The classes are fairly inexpensive and are mostly populated with locals. Some of the surf instructors do speak English.

===Sights===

[[File:MAC Nit.jpg|thumb|right|Across Guanabara Bay, one of Rio's best views (one that includes both the Christ and the Sugarloaf in your camera frame) can be seen from this Museum in [[Niterói]],  only 20 minutes away from downtown Rio by ferry boat]]

[[File:Brazil vs Honduras, men's football tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Maracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Maracanã stadium, once the largest on Earth]]

[[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Q506938|Corcovado]], the {{m|710}} granite peak located in the Tijuca Forest in central Rio is known worldwide for the [[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Q79961|Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue]]. The funicular train up costs R$62 (low season) or R$75 (high season) for a round trip up to Cristo Redentor, and it is definitely worth the view. The queue for the train, in Cosme Velho, can get rather long; you purchase a ticket for a particular departure time (that day only). The box office at the station does not sell same-day tickets. The trains run every 30 minutes. Try going when the morning coach parties have already passed through, i.e. when most tourists are having their lunch. Don't take the train too late in the day since late afternoon trains may be canceled if delays throughout the day build up. This is common over holiday weekends. Take a taxi to Cosme Velho, or take the Metro-Onibus Expresso combination (see above) from the Largo do Machado station. After dark, be aware that the steep descent down Corcovado in a shuttle can be dangerous since some less-professional park drivers choose to speed down the mountain to create a roller-coaster type effect and even turn the headlights off temporarily to thrill the passengers. If this occurs, passengers should tell the driver to stop by shouting "Pare!" (PAH-ree). Report any such conduct to a police officer at the base of the park before you descend to the base of the mountain by taxi. There's also a hiking trail that begins at Parque Lage and gets there (see Hiking and Trekking on the 'Do' section below).

Pão de Açúcar, the [[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Q210722|Sugarloaf Mountain]] (one taller, the other shorter), Brazil's top landmark, with a two-stage aerial tramway to the top; a definite must-see. There is also an unsigned trail leading to the second station. Ask locals for directions. The buses number 511, 512, 591 and 592 and the subway buses from Botafogo bring you to the base station. Do not make the mistake of thinking you have seen enough once you have seen the view from Cristo Redentor. Try Sugarloaf at sunset for a truly mind-blowing experience.

[[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Q429897|Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas]] is a large lagoon in the middle of South Zone, with great views to Corcovado and Ipanema and Leblon beaches; you can jog or cycle all the way round; there are skating areas and you can hire little pedal-operated boats.

[[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Norte#Q155174|Maracanã]] the largest football stadium in South America and once the largest on Earth. It is in a state of disrepair following the Summer 2016 Olympics, and daily tours have been suspended. There is also a Soccer Museum inside it.

[[Rio de Janeiro/Centro#Q1864964|Streetcar of Santa Teresa]], Brazil's only remaining metropolitan heritage streetcar.

[[File:QUINTA BV RJ Brazil.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Quinta da Boa Vista, a park where Rio's Zoo is located.]]

[[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Q2383714|Jardim Botânico]], the Botanical Garden, planted in the 1800s. It is both a park and a scientific laboratory contains a huge collection of plants from all over the world, not only tropical ones.

[[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Q7139641|Parque Lage]] a small park containing some interesting plants and wildlife as well as strange concrete structures that will entertain the kids. The park is the beginning of a hiking trail Corcovado, through sub-tropical rain forest.

[[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Q5457206|Parque do Flamengo]], also known as Aterro do Flamengo is along the bay between Flamengo and Glória. 1.2 million square metres with broad walkways, Flamengo Beach, various monuments, and over 10,000 trees.

===Museums===
There is no shortage of things to do on a rainy day. In addition to a wide range of museums, Rio has many cultural centres, which are run by banks and other organizations and usually host free exhibitions. Details of what is on can be found in the '''Segundo Caderno''' section of the daily '''O Globo''' newspaper, which provides more detail in a weekly Friday supplement. Also very useful is the '''Mapa das Artes Rio de Janeiro''', which provides detailed bi-monthly listings as well as detailed maps of the city. This is free and can be picked up at most museums.

===Carnaval===
[[Image:Sambodromo.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Sambodrome at night, where thousands spend the night dancing, singing and celebrating their favorite samba school (comparable to soccer teams) till dawn]]

Still the greatest reason for visiting Rio seems to be the '''Carnaval'''. This highly advertised party lasts for almost two weeks and it is well known for the ''escolas de samba'' (samba schools) that parade in Centro, on a gigantic structure called ''Sambódromo'' (Sambadrome). During Carnaval, Rio has much more to offer though, with the ''blocos de rua'', that parade on the streets. There are now hundreds of these street "samba blocks", that parade almost in every neighborhood, especially in Centro and the South Zone, gathering thousands of people. Some are very famous, and there are few ''cariocas'' that have not heard of "Carmelitas", "Suvaco de Cristo", "Escravos da Mauá" or "Simpatia É Quase Amor".

The rest of the year, samba shows are popular with tourists, and are held at several venues like ''Plataforma'' and ''Scala''. These are expensive and not really representative of Brazilian culture, they present a lot of almost naked women and bad musicians, a tourist trap (much like the real thing.) Much more interesting and genuine, though, are the night practice sessions held by the various samba schools in the months leading up to Carnaval. You will find only a small number of tourists here, and you will be served the best caipirinhas of your trip! These go on into the wee hours of the morning, with the fun really only starting at 1-2AM A good cab driver should be able to hook you up, and cabs will be available to take you back when you are samba-ed out. Salgueiro and Mangueira are good choices, as they are two of the larger samba schools, and are located relatively close to the tourist areas in a fairly safe area.

A change is afoot that may make this genuine experience a thing of the past (or more convenient, depending on your viewpoint) for all but the most savvy tourists. The local government built a complex of buildings ([http://cidadedosambarj.globo.com Cidade do Samba]{{Dead link|date=March 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}) where many of the samba schools moved their practice halls and float-construction facilities from the gritty warehouses typically located in or near their home favelas. One can expect many more tourists, and shows made-up for the tourists as the tourist bureau milks this facility for all it's worth year-round.

===Music===

Rio was the cradle of three of Brazil's most important musical genres: samba, choro, and bossa nova. There has been a boom of traditional samba and choro venues. A lot of them are in the downtown district of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)/Centro|Lapa]]. There are good and cheap nightlife options, where you will see some of the best musicians of the country. Any of the city newspapers provide pointers to the best shows.

If you're not such an anthropological type of tourist, you can check out the same papers for tips on other kinds of music. Being a big city, Rio has big and small clubs that play almost every kind of music. The major mainstream clubs mostly play whatever's on the Radio - which is usually whatever's on the USA radios and MTV - but the underground scene has a lot to offer on Rock, EDM, Rap and such. The best way to find out about those are the flyers handed or left at hostels, cinema and theater lobbies, nightclub lines, etc.

===New Year's Eve celebrations===

Rio hosts the country's largest and most popular New Year's Eve celebrations. The huge fireworks display and music shows attract 2 million people to the sands of Copacabana beach every year. People dress in white for luck and toast the arrival of the new year. It's usual also to have some national and international concerts on the beach for free.

===Gay Travel===

Rio de Janeiro is the main destination for lesbian and gay travellers from all over Brazil and the rest of the world. The city has been chosen as the best lesbian and gay international destination in 2009, and the sexiest gay place in the world in 2010 and 2011.

===Hang gliding and paragliding===

The Hangliding and Paragliding flights have found in Rio de Janeiro, the ideal land for its high hills and favorable wind. Different from other places in the world, in Rio, the sport could be done in urban areas and landing on the beach!
These conditions naturally attract many tourists who get the courage to enjoy a flight. And even the most inexperienced person can flight since there's no training or special gear needed.

===Hiking and Trekking===

Not surprisingly, a huge city that has an actual forest within its limits has lots to offer for hikers. It's always advisable to have a local with you when trekking in Rio ([https://www.couchsurfing.com/events/50-cs-group-on-line-meetings-mondays Couchsurfing's Rio de Janeiro group] usually organizes hikes around the city), as some treks are not very well-marked. Since the early 2000s there hasn't been any reports of violence/burglary on the city's trails (a problem in the 90s), but the rules on the Stay safe section apply as anywhere else in the city. Some of Rio's hiking trails include:

* '''Parque Lage - Corcovado'''
The trek is fairly demanding and steep, and takes about 1h30/2h to complete, but yet very popular among locals - it's normal to see whole families doing it, as well as groups of friends and foreigners. Buy the "Metrô + Metrô Na Superfície" ticket and go to ''Botafogo''. From there, take the metrô bus to the station ''Hospital da Lagoa'', which is close to the ''Parque Lage''. Ask the park's staff or look for signs that say "Trilha" to get to the start of the trail, just behind the ruins of an old house. From there you have two paths: going straight ahead leads to a waterfall that is usually full of families on the weekends (it's a good spot to stop on your way back if you go back the same way), and left leads straight to the main path of the trek. Along the way there are 3 waterfalls (just one you can actually bath in, though) and a small path where you have to hang on to a chain to pass through some rocks. Until this point you will be going up, but always surrounded by forest. The first views of the city will start after the chain (about 1h/1h30 in). Then you get to the train tracks, either follow the rail tracks or the road up to the Christ (another 15 minutes). Views from here on are breathtaking. To go back down, you can get a van or walk about half a mile down to the parking place.

* '''Sugarloaf'''
This is a short and fairly easy hike, taking about 20/30' to complete, also very popular among locals, specially because you can go up for free then hitch a ride back on the cable car (after 7PM, it's free to return on it). The hike begins at Pista Cláudio Coutinho in Urca, and is very popular among the locals. If you ask the guards they'll point you to the start. It's uphill, but just the first five minutes are really steep and will need you to use your hands. From there on just keep to your left. There are amazing views of Urca and the Guanabara Bay during the final 20 minutes, some of which are angles you don't get from the vantage points above. The trek actually ends on top of Morro da Urca, the smallest of the two.

===Panoramic flights===
If you have the money the following operators give you panoramic flights in helicopters:

| phone= | tollfree= | fax=

}}

===Favela (Shantytown) tours===
A number of operators offer tours of Rocinha, the largest and safest Favela in Rio. Many tours are done by outside companies in safari-like buses, which can lead to awkward interactions with the locals. Try to go with someone who lives in Rocinha on a walking tour. It is also possible to arrange tours to other favelas, although Rocinha has a longer history of tourism and is one of the more developed favelas.

You may hear stories about people being invited by locals to visit their home in a favela. If you receive such an invitation do think carefully about it and perhaps ask around about the person that has invited you. Many of the favelas are rife with drugs and guns so think carefully about how much you trust the person that is inviting you. A search on the Internet may reveal some accounts of tours others have taken. A visit like this will obviously be more authentic than a book tour and could be the highlight of your visit to Rio; on the other hand you are taking a risk. Also consider that favelas are normal neighbourhoods in Rio and not a zoo.

=== Out of town trips ===
*Praia do Abricó – 50 km in the west. The best public naturist beach around Rio, located in Grumari, right after Prainha. Facilities and telephone service are quite limited, so plan ahead.
*[[Paquetá]] - Though not exactly outside of Rio, because it is an island and can only be reached by a 70 minutes ferry ride, this district of Rio makes an excellent (and inexpensive) day trip. The island is an car-free zone, so travel is limited to bicycles and electric golf carts. There's not a lot to do on this island, but the ferry ride is worth it.


==Sleep==
[[Image:Arpoador.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset at Arpoador, best in Rio]]
In the '''[[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Sleep|Zona Sul]]''', you will find Rio's fanciest and most popular hotels along the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana, but there are lots of small, cheap, clean hotels around Flamengo and Catete. The street in front of the strip of tourist hotels in Copacabana can be seedy, due to both garishly-dressed tourists, and a few opportunistic locals ready to take advantage of them. The apart-hotels in Ipanema are a much more pleasant alternative, being both better appointed and in a nicer neighborhood with fewer tourists.

Accommodation in the lower '''[[Rio de Janeiro/Centro#Sleep|Centro]]''' can be convenient for business travellers. The surrounding areas, however, are far from pleasant at night, being nearly deserted and lacking decent restaurants and leisure options. The central '''Santa Teresa''' neighbourhood, however, is quite departed from the city centre life and has plenty of pleasant bed and breakfasts and a significant nightlife.

Given Rio's rise as a fashionable destination with creative and fashion people, some hotels that cater to the '''design-conscious''' crowd have also been popping up at the most upscale neighborhoods. The city also has a large selection of '''apart-hotels''', which provide apartment-style accommodations with kitchen facilities. Private condominium '''apartments''' can also be rented short-term at reasonable rates, and can be found on the internet. This is probably a preferable means of finding one of these than the notes that will be passed to you by anonymous persons on the street. These apartments generally have a one-week minimum, or two weeks during Carnaval or New Years holidays.

Accommodation in Rio is probably '''Brazil's most expensive'''. There is a relative shortage of hotel rooms on the cheaper range and booking in advance is recommended. Moreover, prices for most accommodation can more than triple during New Year's and Carnaval. Those are very busy periods and booking ''well'' in advance is recommended. Most hotels in tourist areas will only sell 4-day packages and charge in advance - even if you want to stay only for a couple of days during those events. Other than those, the busiest month is January - summer holidays in Brazil.

Motels, that you will see mainly on the outskirts of the city, are not motels in the North American sense. Rather, they are places you go with your lover for a few hours. One famous motel, overlooking the Sheraton in Leblon, was taken over by the US Secret Service when George Bush Sr stayed at the Sheraton. It is not recorded whether heart-shaped beds, mirrors on the ceiling and on-tap porno movies affected their work!

If '''hostel''' life is more your style, they are easy to find in Rio. The more expensive ones boast locations that are short walking distance to either Ipanema or Copacabana beach. However, if you prefer to stay in Lapa, Glória, Catete, and Botafogo, there are many other choices available. Hostelling has become increasingly popular in Brazil, and many of them are located at walking distance from hot spots. Beware, however, not to be taken to any fraudulent scheme - you might end up being robbed. Look for accredited places with Youth Hostelling International and similar franchises.

To experience Rio from another point of view, there's also the opportunity to stay in various hostels in one of the favelas. Due to presence of many police units (called Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora, UPP), it is reasonably safe to stay in some favelas. Ask your hosts about the actual situation, though. See for example [[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Norte#Sleep|Zona Norte]] for a stay in the ''Complexo do Alemão''.


==Eat==
In Rio de Janeiro you can probably find something to fit any craving. A good approach to local food is "comida a kilo" - buffet style restaurants where you pay by the weight of the food on your plate. An excellent place to go with your friend or even with your partner is the Fellini restaurant. Located in Leblon, the place has a "pay for what you eat" buffet, with really good and beautiful food. Great for all tastes, it has even Asian food on the menu. Another one is Ming Yue, Rue do Lavradio 106, near Lapa. Ming Ye offers a wide range of Chinese stir-fry and delicious sushi, as well as Brazilian dishes for cheaper prices.

Don't miss the most famous Brazilian dish, '''feijoada''' (fay-zho-AH-da), a black bean stew filled with big chunks of meat, like sausage, pork and beef. Along with the "feijoada", you also get some colorful side dishes that come with it, such as rice, cassava (roasted manioc), collard greens, fried pork rinds, and some orange slices, to sweeten things up a bit. This is bonafide, authentic ''carioca'' culinary excellence, almost worth the trip alone! Best while sipping down a "caipirinha".

For the hungry, nothing beats a good ''rodízio'' (all-you-can-eat service). These are available in numerous types, although the most well-known are the ''churrascaria'', all-you-can-eat grilled meats. '''[http://marius.com.br/ Marius]''', in [[Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul#Buy|Leme]] has arguably the best ''churrascaria'' in town. '''[http://www.carretaoipanema.com.br/ Carretão]''' has a good and cheap(er) rodizio. At various restaurants around town, you can also find ''rodízio'' style dining featuring seafood, pizza, or various appetizer-style snacks. The defining element of rodízio is that unlike an all-you-can-eat buffet, the servers continuously bring skewers of various meats.

If you like meat but want an alternative to the rodizios, a good place to eat at is '''Filé de Ouro''' (Rua Jardim Botânico, 731, Jardim Botânico; {{phone| +55 21 2259-2396}}; see Google Maps for directions). The place is simple and cozy. During the weekends there are usually big lines, but the steak is delicious. Try "Filé à Oswaldo Aranha", with toasted garlic.

[[Brazil]] has the largest population of Japanese outside of [[Japan]], and sushi has become widely popular in Rio too. If you are a sashimi and sushi lover, you will find a great deal of options in Rio de Janeiro. If you are in Ipanema or nearby, a great tip is '''[http://www.benkei.com.br/ Benkei] {{dead link|December 2020}}''', that has an "all you can eat" buffet, with high quality products, great environment and staff for nice prices.

As a former ex Portugal colony, Brasil has maintained many influences of this country on its culinary. Therefore, you will find great authentic Portuguese restaurants in Rio. A good option, from the localization to the ambiance, and naturally the food, is the '''CBF Restaurant''', in the Tiradentes Square, a lovely area full of antique architecture.

In Ipanema, '''[http://www.zazabistro.com.br Zazá Bistrô]''' is a trendy, sexy and exotic place with great South Asian dishes. Good to go as a couple.

Because its huge coast, many Brazilian specialties are in the seafood area. They are very rich in shrimps, lobster, calamaris, shellfish, clams, mollusks and many other tasty fishes. So, once in this land, don't miss the opportunity to order those lovely dishes. 

The highest recommendation for a decently priced superb meal is at '''Sobrenatural''', that has the some of the freshest fish in Rio. Go on Monday, Wednesday or Friday, when they have live samba and chorinho music by renowned artists. Try their moqueca dishes. It is located at Rua Almirante Alexandrino, 432 Santa Teresa.

For sophisticated people who enjoy simple life, '''[http://www.viasete.com.br Via Sete]''' is in the heart of Ipanema, on Garcia D'Ávila. This grill restaurant offers a great bang for the buck: from their veranda you get to people-watch pretty Brazilians. There you can enjoy tasty wraps and sandwiches.

Travellers with fatter pockets may also splash out a bit at the Dias Ferreira street in Leblon, Rio's up-and-coming restaurant row.

There are many places to get pizza and lots of restaurants also offer pasta.

Rio is also famous for its pastries and street food, heritage from Portuguese and old European culture. In most cafeterias (''lanchonete''; lun-sho-NETCH) you can have a ''pastel'' (pahs-TELL) or ''salgado'' (saw-GAH-do; local pastry). Typical pastries are ''coxinha'' (ko-SHEEN-ya; chicken nugget shaped like a chicken leg), and unique Rio's ''joelho'' (zho-EH-lyo; rolled dough filled with ham and cheese). Also try ''pão de queijo'' (pawn-deh-KAY-zho; cheese baked dough), typical from [[Minas Gerais]] but very common in Rio as well, and ''tapioca'' (typical from [[Bahia]]), a kind of crepe made out of manioca flour.

For drinking, ask for ''guaraná'' (gwa-ra-NAH; soda made from the seed of an Amazon fruit, also available as a strong drink), ''mate'' (MAHTCH; sweet ice tea; not like [[Rio Grande do Sul]] or [[Argentina]]'s hot and sour ''mate''), ''água de coco'' (ah-gwa-djee-KOH-ku; natural coconut water) or ''caldo de cana'' (caw-do-djee-KAH-na; sugarcane juice). There is also a common fruit called ''açaí'' (ah-sah-EEH), with a dark-purple pulp out of which are made juices, and ice-creams. Typical cariocas eat it like cream in cups or glasses, mixed with ''granola'', oats or other flakes. The best place for such drinks are one of a number of Rio's open juice bars. Very often, these are located on street corners and have long, curved bars offering you juices from pretty much every fruit you can imagine. The best option is a small chain of juice bars called '''"Big Bi's"'''. The juices are astounding value alongside their good selection of salgados and sandwiches. Their açaí is one of the best in terms of value and taste and the staff are excellent. On top of all this, if you leave a tip, you get a big "''Obrigado''" from all the staff. For the best Big Bi's experience, try the Tangerina ao Limão juice along with the famous Bauru sandwich. Finish it all off with an açaí to go. Perfect. Big Bi's has a few branches dotted around Copacabana and Ipanema, one of which is on the corner of Rua Santa Clara and Rua Barata Ribeiro in Copacabana. If you then cross the road of Rua Barata Ribeiro, you will land at an exquisite ice cream parlour.

There are many specialized "health food" shops that offer an incredible variety of rich meat and vegetable sandwiches, plus an awesome variety of fruit juices, many of them delicious and usually unknown by foreigners. Among them are graviola, fruta do conde, jaca, açaí, guaraná, pitomba, mango, coconut, orange, lemon, papaya, melon, etc. (they make it as you ask and all food is 100% organic and fresh. The meal is often prepared as you wait, so you can ask them to mix whatever fruit you want and create a customized mix if you like). You must try açaí and guaraná, Amazon fruits which are famous to be the strongest energizers and anti-oxidants of the world. They also offer Brazilian snacks (including many Italian and Oriental delicacies), and other simple but delicious things to eat. I never got enough of them! These shops usually are cheap and hang many fruits at the entrance or somewhere visible to display their quality.

Warning: look for clean places, as hygiene can be poor in many street shops.

If your palate is homesick for more familiar tastes, Rio has most of the fast-food chains found around the world (McDonald's, KFC, Domino's, Outback, Subway, Pizza Hut and Burger King). Bob's and Habib's are the biggest national fast food chains.

Many foods that in other countries are simply picked up in the hands and eaten, are either eaten with knife and fork (such as pizza) or are picked up by wrapping a napkin around the food so that it is not touched with the hands (such as sandwiches). You will undoubtedly notice napkin dispensers on the tables in most restaurants for this purpose.

'''After Hours'''

Leaving a club or a bar, late in the night? The best option is '''Cervantes''' in Prado Júnior Street, in Copacabana. It closes only with the sun raising. The menu is composed by big sandwiches, with whatever you want: ham, salami, cheese, tenderloin and so on, with one home special ingredient: a big pineapple slice. It's a tropical taste to the end of your night. Look out for the legendary "Penguin Waiter", who've been working there forever. You won't have a problem to find out who he is.
