        <description>In summer there is a cable car from Trapani. In winter there is an enjoyable trip in a local bus. There are 2 roads - both long and twisty and drivable with care if you are a foreigner. Car parking is only charged June to September. Off season there is plenty of off and on-street parking. You should avoid entering the old city streets as they are very narrow and slippery when wet, though not largely out of bounds.</description>

The Salinas Regional Archeological Museum (Piazza Olivella, Palermo), housed in an ex-monastery, boasts one of Sicily's better collections, with a number of Sicanian, Phoenician, Greek and Roman finds, as well as some interesting Paleo-Christian and Arab items. Parts of the ruined temple of Himera (near Termini Imerese) are housed here. In the courtyards numerous Roman statues are displayed in open air. Of particular interest is the Palermo Stone brought from Egypt. The Regional Art Gallery (Via Alloro 4, Palermo) in the charming medieval Palazzo Abatellis houses a fine art collection, featuring many medieval Byzantine and Norman-Arab works. The City Art Gallery (Piazza Sant'Anna, off Discesa dei Giudici, Palermo), located in a large former monastery, has a collection of modern works, particularly eighteenth and nineteenth century paintings in the Romanticist and Expressionist styles. The cathedral has its own small museum, the Tesoro. While it does not house a permanent collection and is not always open to the public, the small Magione monastery museum (Via Teatro Garibaldi 27 off Piazza Magione in the Kalsa district) occasionally presents interesting exhibits. The Oratorio del Rosario, in Via Bambinai behind the San Domenico Basilica, houses Van Dyck's Madonna of the Rosary as well as works by Serpotta and Novelli.]]></description>

This is a "must see" if you have any interest in ancient archeology. Several items, such as the Landolina Venus, are world-famous, leading historians to consider this Sicily's finest archeological museum. (It is certainly better organized than Palermo's.) The Regional Art Gallery (Palazzo Bellomo, Via Capodieci, Ortygia, Siracusa) contains an excellent collection of Byzantine and medieval art. The small but interesting Papyrus Museum (Viale Teocrito 66) is also worth a visit. Caravaggio's Burial of Saint Lucy is housed in the Church of Santa Lucia off Piazza Duomo.]]></description>

The columns are of a "rough" finish because they were apparently never "fluted", the temple never reached completion. The temple seems also to have lacked a roof over the cella (main chamber) in antiquity, rather uniquely - scholars are in disagreement as to whether the temple was deliberately planned this way, or just never completed. Entry is charged.<br> Ancient Theatre - an amazing hilltop feature built by the Greeks c 400BC, known by the Romans and rediscovered in the 19th Century. Hosts dramatic theatre in the Summer months.]]></description>

Constructed to plans drawn by Marvuglia in 1799, the Villa and its oriental gardens reflect the "Chinese Revival" architectural style, albeit with certain Neo Classical elements. It was one of the largest Oriental style residences built in Europe during that period, and it was much preferred by the monarch and his consort, Queen Maria Carolina. Another resident of the Chinese Villa was Ferdinando's son and heir, Francesco I, who lived here with his wife, Maria Isabella of Spain, who gave birth to the future Ferdinando II at Palermo in 1810. The Chinese Villa is located in the Favorita Royal Park near the hamlet of Pallavicino. The nearby Pitré Folk Museum is open to the public.]]></description>

Each of the different 'langues' (knights of a particular nationality had their own langue) has a their own chapel lined along the side of the nave in which they try and outdo each other in splendour. The barrel shaped ceiling is a single huge fresco, the lifework of famed artist Mattia Preti. And last but not least the floor is entirely taken by knight's graves all intricately inlaid marble in different colours, a recent book on the subject describes it as the 'most beautiful floor in the world.' This relatively unknown cathedral can count itself one of the most impressive in Europe. Open from 9:30am until 4:30pm on weekdays and from 9:30am until 12:30pm on Saturdays. Entrance is through the Carappechia Annex on Republic Street in between St John's Street and St Lucy Street, directly opposite the Law Courts. As soon as you enter you will be provided with an audio guide included in the entrance fee which leads you through the cathedral in 24 stops enabling you to get further historical information about the paintings and special parts of St. John’s Co-Cathedral.]]></description>

But this little gem is worth a visit.<br><br>Notably, the St. Cataldus catacombs hold one of the best examples of an agape table, a circular platform hewn out of the rock used for early Christian funerary rituals. After a body was interred, and once a year on the anniversary of the burial, relatives would gather in the catacomb for a celebratory meal to commemorate the dead.<br><br>The catacombs are accessed by a steep staircase in the church. The stairway leads to a vault that opens into the Baldachin-style tombs, where an arch in the corner is decorated with pictures of doves. Dating from the late 2nd to the 3rd centuries, these small catacombs were originally a Punic burial shaft. The graves in the catacombs are beautiful examples of canopied tombs, while many other graves are hewn in the rocks.]]></description>

Like the Cathedral of St. John in Valletta its floor is covered with intricately inlaid marble gravestones belonging to Maltese aristocracy. Also noteworthy is the impressive wallpainting at the back of the cathedral depicting the shipwrecking of st Paul on Malta. Interestingly the face has two clocks (one for time and one for date). There is an apocryphal (though much repeated and widely published) story that the reasoning was to have one clock which showed the correct time and one which serves to confuse the devil.</description>

Perhaps the the most important is a beautiful set of woodcut prints The Life of the Virgin by Albrecht Dürer. Furthermore it has a collection of the cathedral's attributes and a tiny display on the 19th century priests who took the first initiative to develop Maltese in a written form. Amazingly, as it was never in the colonial power's interest and the Maltese had to do without writing in their own language since the Arabs left in the 11th century. The entire archive of the inquisition in Malta, which was only banned by Napoleon the day he invaded, is kept here, but is unfortunately not on public display. If you come with serious credentials you may be able to persuade Father Michael to show them to you.]]></description>

It now houses a mediocre local art collection on the ground floor and a slightly random collection of historic furniture and paintings upstairs. Do see the painting of Mary proferring her bared breast to her child with a strangely lascivicious look on her face. Also do visit the cellars of the museum which connect to another set of ancient catacombs, these have not been 'streamlined' for tourism like the other catacombs which make them particularly interesting.]]></description>

During the Great Siege of 1565 the Turks made the mistake of choosing to first try and take this fort, for which they had planned a week. Instead the knights and soldiers present fought desperately for a month, buying essential time. The knights in the fort knew they were fighting to the death, and so rather than being taken off the ramparts when wounded, knights would fight on while seated in chairs until they couldn't even lift their arms any more. Today the fort houses the Police Academy and is only partially open on the weekend.]]></description>

        <name>Valley of the Temples</name>
        <description><![CDATA[The Valley of Temples [3] is an archaeological area and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It stretches along a ridge to the south of the city are a string of five Greek temples, a sight worthy of comparison to the Acropolis itself in Athens. The temples are usually divided into two zones: the Eastern Zone and Western Zone each side of the main entrance and the road from the city centre. It can get punishingly hot in summer and there is little shade other than some olive trees along the ridge itself. Entrance costs €12 plus extra for an audio tour (€5) or a simple map (€1,20) (October 2018). Note that the entrance is free on the first Sunday of a month but the waiting time can be much longer.<br><br> -The first temple east of the entrance is the Tempio di Ercole or Temple of Hercules - long, thin and about 1/3 standing. It is the oldest of the temples, built towards the end of the 6th century BC. Next to it are some interesting deep ruts formed by ancient carriages.<br> - Next heading east is the large Tempio della Concordia or Temple of Concord - a very impressive almost complete structure built around 440-450 BC.<br> - The track the continues above small cliffs at the edge of the ridge to the Tempio di Giunone or Temple of Juno. Partially ruined, it offers a great spot to look back down the ridge to the other temples.<br> - To the west of the main entrance is the massive Tempio di Giove or Temple of Jupiter which was never completed and is now in ruins with little structure visible. Most notable is one of the huge stone statues now lying on the ground.<br> - Behind this is the small ruined Tempio dei Dioscuri or Tempio di Castore e Polluce (Temple of Castor and Pollux).<br> - Beyond the main temple site is the small, but interesting Tomba di Terone.<br> - Garden of the Kolymbetra within the Valley of the Temples and not far from the temple of the Dioscuri.<br><br>To put all these sights in context, it is well worth visiting the Archeological Museum (half way back into the city centre) and the adjacent Roman Quarter (with a few nice mosaics). Daily guided tours of the Valley of the Temples can be hired from Visit Agrigento [4] though an audio tour is available at the entrance to the temples. (Some ID is required as security for these, which means walking back the entire length of the site just to give the guide back).<br><br>To get to the valley of the temples by public transport, take bus 1, 2 or 3 from the square outside the train station. You can bus tickets from the bar in the station.]]></description>

        <name>Mount Etna</name>
        <description><![CDATA[https://wikitravel.org/en/Mount_Etna<br><br>The mountain has an eerie volcanic landscape, with solidified "rivers" of lava. It is used for skiing in winter, so be prepared for the cold at this altitude, even in summer. Even in good weather in summer, sometimes the top of the mountain is covered in cloud, especially during the afternoon, obscuring the wonderful views. <br><br><br>Im not OP, but i live around Catania. You can see Mt. Etna in about 4 hours max, and thats if you chill for lunch up there in some of the mediocre restaurants. If you go up the south side from Nicolosi then its pretty barren, like all volcanic fields fine sand and some volcanic rock. The view is great if its clear, youll be able to see all of Catania and the sea. It would be further from Taormina.<br><br>If you go up the North side from Linguaglosa then its more alpine like, but there is no view because of the trees.<br><br>Basically the view is worth seeing, but honestly the view of the sea and stuff from Taormina or Castelmola is better. I would avoid it if its raining or cloudy since you wont be able to see the city from the mountain. I have once stayed at Murgo, which is a winery close by, its a decent agritursmo and the wine is famous in Sicily.<br><br>----<br>For Visitors: Remember that it's always quite a bit cooler on Etna than it is in the valleys or along the coast. There are several roads into the park, and even a railway line from Catania to Riposto (though with only occasional departures), as well as bus service from Catania.<br><br>Recommended itineraries:<br><br>Western Slope: Monte Gallo and Rifugio della Galvarina. Start at the clearing on the slope of Mount Gallo, reached via the Nicolosi-Adrano road, following the road for about 12 kilometers to the sign indicating Monte Intraleo. This hike leads to the Galvarina forest refuge.<br><br>Casa Pirao to Monte Spagnolo to Cisternazza. This hike takes about five hours. It starts from the Case Pirao on the northern slope, reached by turning off the Linguaglossa-Randazzo road just outside Randazzo. This excursion will take you through the Mount Spagnolo beech wood.<br><br>Monte Nero degli Zappini Nature Trail. This trail offers a view of some of the typical natural settings of the area. It starts from Piano Vetore, which is not far from the Grande Albergo dell'Etna.<br><br>Mount Zoccolaro Nature Trail. Not far from Zafferana Etnea, this steep trek offers spectacular views of the Calanna Valley and the Valle del Bove with patches of aspen and beech woods along the way. Exercise caution because the path is flanked by a steep precipice.]]></description>

        <name>Archaic Greek Emporium</name>
        <description>Between the Acropolis, nearer to the sea, is located Emporio Greco Arcaico identified by the numerous structures (over 10), that belong to a large neighborhood. There are buildings consisting of rather regular quadrangular walled compartments preserved up to more than 2 m high and in some cases retain the laying line of the ancient roof beams. In one of the structures is integrated the entrance door composed of jambs and lintel. The riser was built of raw bricks, dried in the sun. A first phase of the life of this area can be dated to the period from the 7th century B.C. until its destruction after 480 B.C., probably due to the natural causes. During the some archaeological excavations there were found three dense altars, dated to the decade 490-480 A.D. and decorated with embossed mythological figures also there were placed the archaic ships found on the seabed in front.</description>

        <description>Gela has its own Acropolis, the symbol of Ancient Greece, located on an elongated hill called Molino a vento, dominated the fertile plain overlooking the river Gela. In the western part of the hill stood the Necropolis. The Acropolis, until 405B.C., housed the main sacred buildings of the city. So, inside the Acropolis, in the Parco delle Rimembranze, are found the remains of a Doric-style temple, the six columns on short sides and eleven on long ones. Later after 405B.C. when the Acropolis was destroyed by the Cartigines Acropolis lost its sacred character and was populated by dwellings arranged on the flanks of the hill. From the archaeological discoveries came a real city district of that period with houses and shops.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[If you're a hiker, the trail to Fossa, the recently (~1890) active volcanic center, should not be missed. The round trip takes about 3 hours from the dock area and involves the gain of about 1300 feet of elevation. Several alternative routes exist once you've reached the top of the cone. The fumarole field on the west side of the crater (Gran Cratere) is fascinating if you can stand the smell (it's one of the few places on the earth's surface where you can view droplets of molten sulfur), but is best avoided if you have respiratory problems.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Stromboli Volcano. This continuously active volcano is one of the few in the world where a visitor can see an eruption "up close and personal," yet in relative safety -- most of the time. However, conditions vary from year to year, and the summit region may be closed (as it was during spring-summer 2007) owing to unusual activity posing hazards to the climber. In most conditions you can hike unaccompanied to an elevation of 400 meters, but beyond this level you will need a guide. A reliable guide service is Magmatrek, Via Vittorio Emanuele, +39 090 9865768, [3], but there are other guide services in town that are also satisfactory. Guided walks cost 25-30 Euro. Don't climb without a guide; the access limitations are enforced (sporadically) and fines are substantial.The excursions leave in the afternoon (3 - 4 pm depending on the time of the sunset) and allow for around 40 - 60 minutes at the craters over the sunset. If it is cloudy at the top of the island, you should not bother climbing as you are unlikely to have sufficient visibility of the craters.]]></description>

The large Roman Villa is UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the highlights of Sicily, with the remains of a large number of rooms covered by a huge canopy to protect the numerous elaborate mosaics, which are very impressive. In fact, you can tell what the room was by the mosaic. For instance, there is a mosaic with a rather plump man being massaged and then rinsed to get into the bath. After the baths, the room shows the man drying off with a big fluffy towel. Also, you know that the first room had to relax before entering the bath and so on. Very interesting is the mosaic of the "Girls in Bikinis" depicting women working out in a gym. There are about 5 buses per day from ”Piazza Senatore Mareschali” (Piazza Armerina), or you could walk, or take a taxi from the nearby Piazza Generale Cascino.]]></description>

        <description>The Necropolis of Pantalica is a collection of cemeteries with rock-cut chamber tombs in southeast Sicily, Italy. Dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC, there was thought to be over 5,000 tombs, although the most recent estimate suggests a figure of just under 4,000. They extend around the flanks of a large promontory located at the junction of the Anapo river with its tributary, the Calcinara, about 23 km (14 mi) northwest of Syracuse. Together with the city of Syracuse, Pantalica was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.</description>

Near the top there are the remains of a disused marble quarry and halfway through you will begin to glimpse a large cross, that will show you the point of arrival.

        <description><![CDATA[• Nebrodi Mountains: An alternate selection to the wine region (described below), the Nebrodi Mountains are the most lushly forested region of Sicily. Situated to the immediate north of Etna, the range boasts some of the island's highest peaks after the volcano itself (though several in the Madonie Mountains to the west exceed them). The unique Nebrodian appeal is its complete departure from any common stereotype of "Mediterranean" landscapes and the visitor's consequent realisation that much of Sicily looked this way when the first Phoenicians, Ausonians and Greeks arrived over two thousand years ago. Our favourite drive is along the SS 289 from Cesarò high in the mountains to San Fratello and Sant' Agata Militello, a truly lush area that, with its high snowfall from late December into the middle of March, often looks more Swiss than Sicilian. A stop at Villa Miraglia, a lodge on the SS 289 in the middle of the forest, offers a chance to sample lamb, goat and the boarish Nebrodian Black Swine, and it's not far from a road leading to Mount Soro - at 1847 meters the highest peak in the chain.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[https://www.visitmalta.com/en/a/golf/<br><br>The Royal Malta Golf Club is the ideal setting for relaxing, working on your handicap, or spending time with friends. Positioned in beautifully maintained grounds and being centrally located in the Mediterranean it enjoys a wonderful climate providing excellent golfing conditions. The RMGC was founded in 1888 when golf was played around the moats and bastions formed by the fortification walls of the Capital City Valletta. One of the founding members was the then Duke of Edinburgh who was serving in Malta at the time and from whom the club received royal patronage. It moved to its present location in 1904, and is now situated in the grounds of the Marsa Sports Club and boasts of being one of only 63 Royal Golf Clubs.<br><br>Due to the temperate climate the18 hole, par 68 course is in excellent condition for all twelve months of the year and is enjoyed on a regular daily basis by locals and visitors. The visitors often return when inclement weather conditions in their own country prevent the opportunity to play. Although only a par 68 it is a challenging course for the experienced player but not over daunting to the novice. As with all golf clubs there are rules relating to dress code and course etiquette and these can be found on the club website. If you just wish just to spend a short time practicing your skills you can make use of the clubs driving range and the pitching and putting areas.<br><br>The very modern clubhouse which is available to members and guests offers exceptional facilities, including an outdoor terrace overlooking the course, the Putters Inn Bar and Restaurant and in addition golfers have the use of excellent changing room facilities and showers. The Pro shop located in the entrance hall offers a wide range of golfing merchandise and the opportunity to hire clubs and trolleys if required.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[https://wikitravel.org/en/Hagar_Qim_and_Mnajdra<br><br>Hagar Qim and Mnajdra - Two very beautiful stone age temples set on the cliffside of south west Malta. Their majesty is now protected by tents and a 2 storey new building nearby. Built around 3600 BC these structures are older than the pyramids.<br><br>The temples are on the west coast and perched on top of the cliffs and overlooking the nature reserve of Filfla. If you are expecting to see acres of temples, this is not the case, but what you do see is a number of carefully constructed stone rooms and structures which were built around 3000BC. The sheer fact that they have survived all this time is quite amazing.<br><br>Entrance to both temples (Hagar Qim Temples and Mnajdra Temples) and the visitor centre cost 9 Euro per person. The visitor centre also houses a gift shop, a restaurant and other facilities.<br><br>Hagar Qim Temple in the nearest one to the road and access to this site is via a newly built visitor centre. Mnajdra is further down the cliff and there is about a 1 km walk downhill to the temples. This is the older of the two temples with parts dating back to 3600BC. There is no shade between the two sites, so bring sun protection if it is a very sunny day. There are some beautiful views over the ocean and towards the little nature reserve island.<br><br>You can get the bus back to Valletta or attempt to walk down the hill to the Blue Grotto. This is a nice walk with some stunning views, and takes probably about 20 minutes at a good pace. But again, there is no shade, so have a good supply of water with you. You can then get the bus here back to Valletta. Be careful of the Taxi's as they will tell you buses very rarely come and try to charge you 20E to drive you to the next town - don't be fooled by their helpfulness. During the day, buses go through Hagar Qim Park at least once every hour.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[The Azure Window, the Inland Sea and the the Blue Hole all make going to the spectacular west coast of Gozo very worthwhile. The Azure Window is a cliff outcropping with a hole in the middle. The Inland Sea is a typically Maltese name in that it slightly exaggerates its size (Mdina is referred to as a city with its 400 inhabitants). It's actually a small lake connected to the sea by a tunnel about 100 meters long through the cliffs. In contrast to Xlendi and Marsalforn this place has been spared from development and makes an unusual and picturesque place to swim. The beach surrounding the lake is unfortunately made of pebbles but there are a few piers and terraces in front of the fishermen's boathouses one can also use. The Blue Hole is not a true blue hole in the geological sense but still makes an amazing spot to dive, having won awards as one of the most beautiful diving spots of Europe. Unfortunately, on Wednesday 8th March, 2017, the Azure Window collapsed after its outer column crumbled down as a result of typical gale winds and strong waves at this time of the year, natural processes which have and are still continuously eroding the coast, mainly on this side (west coast) of the islands. A stump is all that is left to be seen.]]></description>

        <name>Blue Lagoon</name>
        <description>The main reason for visiting the island for by far the most people is the so called Blue Lagoon (Malt: Bejn il-Kmiemen) [4], a stunning lagoon located on the northwest side of the island which has exceedingly clear azure-blue water. Unfortunately in the high season between 10:00 and 16:00 several hundred people swamp it each day, snackbars are set up on the pristine waterfront, deckchairs are rented out and all kinds of different craft go in and out of the lagoon ferrying visitors back and forth. The best time therefore to come is early in the morning as this is also when the water sparkles the most beautifully in the sun.</description>

The most underrated Blue Flag beach on the island, Gnejna Bay is a quiet sandy beach used predominantly by local residents. Reach it via 30 minute countryside walk from Mgarr that takes in forts and old castellos. Be wary of the return walk uphill if travelling with small children. The water is spectacular and there is ample opportunity to climb and explore. Local fisherman attempt to catch sea bream and will happily give you an overview of Malta's fishing industry. There are toilets and changing facilities on site maintained to a decent standard. Compared to Golden Bay this is not a tourist beach so be sure to bring your own refreshments. edit]]></description>

A small fee (entrance €2, shower €1) is charged to enter this area, which is based on natural hot springs both inland and in shallow offshore waters. Bathers use the former to cover themselves in mud (reputed to have therapeutic powers) and then go into the spring-warmed sea to wash off. Swimsuits are not optional here, and it's a good idea to use a suit that you won't be wearing in more conventional settings for a while (and that you can bag in some airtight container after use), as a sulfurous odor will continue to emanate from the suit for some time after you exit the baths.]]></description>

        <description>The best souvenir shop (the least worthless trinkets etc.) can be found at the Malta experience, but there are many other reasonable souvenir shops in Valletta. At the beginning of the Republic street there are several reasonable souvenir shops but prices are far cheaper if you walk 20m down South street (turn left if you have the bus station behind you) which crosses Republic street very soon after you have entered through the city gates.</description>

A popular restaurant and hangout run by the Sammut family since it opened in the 1940s. The owners have also recently opened the underground shelter where many locals took refuge during WW2. The shelter is extensive, maintained and includes a short film. The restaurant serves some of the best rabbit on the island and has an varied menu of traditional Maltese dishes. Portions are sizeable and expect plate after plate of additional snails and bread at no additional cost. Expect to see locals chatting outside and enjoying the bucolic views. Be sure to join in, the residents of Mgarr are among the friendliest citizens of Malta. Booking on an evening is necessary and be sure to arrive before lunch to see the shelter. ££. edit</description>

        <description><![CDATA[The main Maltese night life district is Paceville (pronounced "pach-a-vil"), just north of St. Julian's. Young Maltese (as young as high school-age) come from all over the island to let their hair down, hence it gets very busy here, especially on weekends (also somewhat on Wednesdays, for midweek drinking sessions). Almost all the bars and clubs have free entry so you can wander from venue to venue until you find something that suits you. However, visitors are advised to be vigilant as there are high instances of alcohol and drug fueled violence in the area. The nightlife crowd becomes slightly older after about midnight, when most of the youngsters catch buses back to their towns to meet curfew. Paceville is still going strong until the early hours of the morning, especially on the weekends. <br><br>In Paceville there is a high level of alcohol and drug-fueled violence in the evenings. This is a holiday destination and rowdiness in bars and nightclubs is to be expected, as is the case in most European cities. There is generally a low police presence.]]></description>

Another spot usually with a good mix of locals and tourists is the bar and courtyard of the Agora Hostel, usually packed on Mondays with live music most weekend nights.

Popular for trips out at night to see magma spurting out of the cone.<br><br>Stromboli is a small Italian volcanic island in the Tyrrhenian Sea just north of Sicily. It is one of the Aeolian Islands. Is is an incredibly beautiful, unique island.<br><br>The island is a single 900 m high volcano, with an area of only 12.6 square kilometres. The volcano is constantly active, and spews lava and rocks down one side of the island. The result is that there are two towns on the parts of the island that are unaffected by the lava flow; Stromboli (the main town) and the smaller Ginostra.<br><br>The island is strikingly beautiful and unique. It is a near-symmetrical triangular shape, and the constant volcano activity means that it often emits a stream of smoke from its craters. At night, you can often see explosions of lava from the observatory that is a 10 minute walk out of town.<br><br>Two kilometres northeast of Stromboli is the small, uninhabited sister island Strombolicchio.<br><br>The island essentially closes down in the colder months from the end of October until it warms up again. During this time, there are almost no hotels open, the restaurants close down, and only one or two cafes and the small supermarket remain open. It is also virtually impossible to find a guide to take you to the crater unless you have arranged a private excursion prior. It is possible to visit the island during this time, but be prepared to fend for yourself.]]></description>

Like many other locations in Malta it can be seen in the recent film The Count of Monte Christo.

        <description><![CDATA[https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Corleone<br><br> Corleone is a small town of approximately 12,000 inhabitants in the province of Palermo in Sicily, Italy. It is known primarily as the birthplace of Mafia boss Salvatore Riina and his faction. Even though the name of the city means “Lion heart,” the Mafia had dominated the local community for decades and only recently segments of the population have begun to rebel against this influence. Also, Corleone is “The City of a 100 Churches”.<br>Understand<br>The town was once dominated by the Arabs, who brought about remarkable economic and political growth and gave it the name Qurlayun. Later the Normans achieved a prominence.<br>At one time the town was surrounded by defensive walls that connected the Castello Soprano and Castello Sottano. The Castello Sottano is better preserved than the Soprano, but it cannot be visited since it serves as a Franciscan retreat.<br>Corleone was known as “Courageous Civitas” because of its position on the front line in all wars fought in Sicily. Halfway between Palermo and Agrigento, the town controlled as one of the main arteries and was therefore one of the most strategic locations on the island.<br>Corleone became a royal property around the end of the 14th century, and later passed into the feudal holdings of Federico Ventimiglia.<br>Remarkable demographic growth was reported between the 15th and 16th centuries, following the arrival of several religious orders.<br>Beginning in the 1960s, the town became famous (or perhaps infamous) for its Mafia, being the town of clan headquarters (the Clan dei Corleonesi). One of the known mafiosi was Toto Riina.<br>The name of the town was used as the adopted surname of the main character in Mario Puzo's book and Francis Ford Coppola's film “The Godfather“. The father of Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino in the film), Don Vito (played by Marlon Brando in The Godfather and Robert DeNiro in The Godfather, Part II) emigrated to the United States from Corleone. Coincidentally, Pacino's own grandparents emigrated from the town of Corleone in the same generation as Don Vito Corleone does in the film.]]></description>

For those who like some trekking there are two possible routes to follow: a dirty road, that reaches the summit and wilder and less practiced path arranged by specific signs. Near the top there are the remains of a disused marble quarry and halfway through you will begin to glimpse a large cross, that will show you the point of arrival. Who reaches the peak is rewarded by a magnificent view of San Vito Lo Capo.<br> Zingaro nature reserve will surround you into the unreal paradise. The steep slopes plunge into the sea, merge with the enchanting bays covered by white pebble. Cala dell'Uzzo or Tonnarella astonish by emerald green and crystal clear waters. They are intimate, solitary, less crowded corners of this pristine coast. Also, there exist other bays such as Cala Capreria, Marinella, Beretta, Varo, Disa or Zingaro.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Monreale. It is a small town in the suburbs of Palermo, 8 km west from it, sitting on the slope of mount Caputo and overlooking the valley of the Conca d’Oro (Golden Shell). Be sure to visit the Duomo (Cathedral)[1] and its cloisters too. The cathedral is one of the richest and most beautiful churches in Italy, which joins Norman, Byzantine, Italian and Saracen styles. The splendid mosaic of Christ Pantocrator is above the altar and it is twinned with the Palatine Chapel in Palermo and the Cathedral in Cefalu. These all Cathedrals is on the listing of UNESCO World Heritage Site. edit<br><br>Monreale: The arcane fact that a mosaic icon of Thomas Becket graces the apse, and that it is the earliest holy image of the English saint murdered in Canterbury Cathedral, is just one of many fascinating features of this twelfth-century cathedral and cloister built on a hill in the eclectic Norman-Arab style with Byzantine artistic elements. (Another "secret" fact is that the heart of Saint Louis is preserved here.) No trip to Palermo is really complete without seeing Monreale, which overlooks the city and its vast valley. Plan to spend at least two hours in this peaceful place. You'll rejoice that you did. If you're here around lunch time (or for dinner) enjoy a pizza at Dietro l'Angolo off a street behind the apse; the view from their terrace is stupendous.]]></description>

        <name>Mdina</name>
        <description><![CDATA[https://wikitravel.org/en/Mdina<br><br>Mdina — Malta's well-preserved quiet old capital (pronounced 'im-dina'). Called the Silent City, Mdina sits in the center of the main island Malta and offers amazing views across the plans to the coast line.<br><br>Do -<br>Walk around and take random turns in the maze-like alleys, the place is so small getting lost won't have you wandering for more than 2 minutes. The Discover Mdina self guided audio tour is worth taking, especially for individual visitors, as it provides loads of information about the several buildings and features of this unique city, which otherwise remain hidden for the visitor. The tour can be taken from the Vilhena Palace just inside the old city's main gate. There are also horse-drawn carriages, the owners who can be quite persistent in offering you a tour. It is important to agree on a price beforehand. A half hour tour is offered and each carriage seats four people. There have been cases where after the tour, the owner says the price is 'per person', charging much more. It is therefore important to agree on the price beforehand. One must also see the view of the north of Malta from the top of the bastions, located in bastions square, just follow the main street of Mdina up to the top. Outside Mdina, there is also the newly refurbished ditch, where one can walk directly under the Bastions of Mdina. <br>--<br><br>L'Mdina (pronounced em-dee-nah) means fortified place in Arabic and was first created as such by the Romans when they separated it from the rest of the town which became Rabat (which means Suburb) and fortified it. This place was already the principal settlement of Malta however since Phoenician times and hence can claim a heritage of 3000 years. Up until the Knights arrived in the mid 1500's it was the capital, the Maltese aristocracy lived there (some, like the Inguanez family still do uninterrupted for over 6 centuries), and the local governing organ called the Universita was housed there. Up until this day it is the seat of the Maltese bishop and the Mdina cathedral still takes precedence over the co-cathedral of St. John.<br><br>As the knights chose Birgu (Vittorosia) as their new capital the Great Siege of 1565 by the Turks was directed there and not at Mdina. The Turkish army passed by Mdina and could have easily taken the crumbling bastion which only had a small group of local soldiers and locals fit to guard it to stop them. A local nun had a vision however that called for a great procession praising god, and so every person in the town was dressed up and paraded around the top of the walls for hours giving the impression to the Turks that Mdina was full to the brim with defenders, and so they left it alone.<br><br>This decision proved fateful because just as the Turks had breached the main gate of Birgu a small band of Maltese rode down from Mdina, and started torching the deserted camp of the Turks making them think that they were being attacked from the rear and causing them to retreat in a panic. The breach was fixed and after that reinforcements from Europe finally arrived and the Turks were defeated. There is still a small chapel in Mdina in honour of this nun whose vision changed the course of European history.<br><br>Under the knights and even more so under the British the importance of Mdina as the seat of power faded steadily, and what was once known as the 'Citta Notabile' became the 'silent city', almost a ghost town. Today most of the palazzos belonging to the old aristocracy are being restored and the tourists bring life to the place, but there are only 400 inhabitants left.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[https://wikitravel.org/en/Sliema<br><br>Sliema and St Julian's are Malta's most modern and most built up areas and where most tourists stay. It is where one will find the most hotels, rental apartments, restaurants, bars, shops and clubs.<br><br>Sliema is a vibrant town where most businesses use English as the main language. All amenities are within walking distance. A large number of foreign families have moved to Sliema recently giving the town a cosmopolitan vibe.<br><br>Sliema and St Julian's form a near continuous town spread over two adjacent peninsulas with St Julian's to the north (about 20 minutes walk) and Valetta and a third peninsula to the south (about 20 minutes drive).<br><br>Malta is a very Catholic country and its people are some of the friendliest and most embracing of tourists in Europe. It is important to note though that certain behavior is strongly frowned upon (such as excessive drunken raucous behavior) and other behavior is illegal (such as topless sunbathing) despite this town being a common tourist area.<br><br>Street names in Malta are written first in Maltese, then in English. it becomes helpful to learn both since some people only use one or the other when giving directions and some maps only give the Maltese (on the assumption that the reader will be able to translate).<br><br>Sliems's main disadvantage is parking! There just isnt enough. This means you can spend 20 minutes looking for parking particularly at night.<br><br>----<br>Do<br>The town is a mostly residential area and as such tourists would tend to travel outside of Sliema during holiday.<br><br>However, there are a number of excellent restaurants in and around Howard Street and a tiny supermarket just off Stella Maris Street.<br><br>The sea front is well developed and offers shaded seating areas often with free wireless internet, an array of cafes, bars and restaurants and some stone beaches with safe and clean swimming areas.<br><br>Sliema is one of the largest and most modern shopping centres in Malta : see 'Buy' below.<br><br>Swimming: Sliema has numerous places for swimming: Exiles; this is a long stretch of beach which ends at Exiles beach club. Currents can be a bit strong at the tip on rough days. Also popular is Font Ghadir near Surfside bar and restaurant. This is really poular with tourists and is great for sunbathing. You can also swim in Tigne with an amazing view of Valletta and Manoel Island.<br><br>Go to a Lido for the day in Summer: There's The Lido, Medasia Playa. All of these also have restaurants, pool and clubbing in the evening during the summer months]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[https://wikitravel.org/en/Victoria_(Malta)<br><br>Victoria — the capital city of Gozo.<br><br>See:<br>Firstly go up to the Citadella and walk around the entire perimeter and enjoy the very beautiful 360 degree view of Gozo at your feet. Visit the cathedral of Gozo, and the Gozo archaeological museum with Islamic tombstone, ask for Steven, show interest and knowledge and he might give you a personal tour of the museum. The other museums in the Citadella are of considerably less interest.<br><br>On the way down from the citadel one can see the Baroque Basilica of Saint George. Saint George's Basilica is a must see for first time visitors. The parish dates back to the 12th century but the present church was built in the 17th century. During the years it has been adorned with multiple treasures, thus nicknaming the Basilica as the 'Golden Church'.<br><br>In March 2013 the Basilica opened the doors to its new modern museum, one of a kind in the country. It is the first building built for the purpose of a museum. The Museum and cultural centre, named as Heart of Gozo: Il-Hagar, displays a rich collection of historical and artistic artefacts previously inaccessible to the general public. The museum is found on the left side of the Basilica.<br><br>Other places of interest include the War Memorial in Independence Square. This monument commemorates Gozitans who died in WWII. The monument is a bronze statue of Christ the King made by sculptor Carlo Pisi of Rome. Queen Elizabeth II unveiled the monument on 7 May 1954.<br><br>The Banca Giuratale is a semi-circular baroque building, which today houses the Victoria Local Council, in Independence Square. The building dates back to 1733 where it served as the official premises of the jurats of Gozo. It was commissioned by Grand Master De Vilhena and the Governor of Gozo.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[https://wikitravel.org/en/Gozo<br><br>Gozo is one of the three islands of the Maltese archipelago situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, just 95km south of Sicily. It is smaller, more remote and less built-up than its sister island Malta, but it is a popular destination in its own right, particularly for more mature British and German couples and those who wish to immerse themselves in the culture of the place. With its pretty countrysides, beautiful sunsets, spectacular coastlines and a high concentration of churches, alongside historic fortifications and megalithic temples it makes a good excursion from Malta and an even better destination for a peaceful and relaxing short break. <br><br>https://www.visitgozo.com/blog/5-walking-routes-that-you-can-trek-hike-in-gozo-this-spring/<br><br>Itineraries<br><br> If one only has one day, it is recommended to spend the morning in the Citadella of Rabat, have lunch there, in the cafe next to the cathedral, and spend the afternoon either at Ramla il-Hamra or The Inland Sea. At least one week is needed to visit in detail the main attractions the island has to offer.<br> With two days one can spend the second morning visiting the Ggantija temples and having lunch on the beautiful central square of Xaghra, and the afternoon at the swimming spot not chosen the previous day, bearing in mind that Ramla il-Hamra beach is very close to Xaghra and the Inland Sea closer to Rabat.]]></description>

It is a coastal town which unfortunately had much of its traditional housing replaced with unregulated buildings such as hotels and prefab rental apartments, it has little accommodation or places to eat particularly worth listing as they're mostly aimed at people coming there on package deals. It has little in the way of attractions or places of interest with the possible exception of St. Paul's Island, its population increases manyfold in the high season. <br><br>At the St. Paul's Bay end of the promenade, you'll come to a small but picturesque harbour with some of the traditionally-painted boats. This harbour also looks out onto St. Paul's Island, where St. Paul was reportedly shipwrecked in the 1st Century A.D.<br><br>There is a Megalithic Temple in the centre of town which is worth visiting. It has a large hotel/casino built around it. Access can be gained through the hotel or casino lobby (feel free to ask the staff for directions if necessary). The hotel/casino is located on the sea front in the middle of the block between Triq Il-Merluzz and Triq Ghawdex and access is easiest from the rear of the building. <br><br>Buġibba comes alive at night. There are only a few clubs, located near the main square, for those seeking an active nightlife but, for those wanting a more relaxed holiday, there are plenty of quiet bars where you can have a drink and a chat. Live entertainment is abundant and most hotels don't mind non-guests coming in to watch. Karaoke is offered in some bars along Tourist Street (Triq it-Turisti on Maltese street signs) for those with less inhibitions than singing talent.]]></description>
